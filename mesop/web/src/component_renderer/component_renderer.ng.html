<!-- box is a special component where we can't delegate it to another
Angular component (e.g. mesop-box) because it will create an intermediate DOM node
which interferes with Flexbox styling which requires children (direct descendants)
to have certain styling properties -->

<ng-container *ngIf="type()?.getName() === 'box' || type() == null">
  <ng-container
    *ngFor="let child of component.getChildrenList(); trackBy: trackByFn"
  >
    <component-renderer [component]="child"> </component-renderer>
  </ng-container>
</ng-container>
