# How-to run

All the commands should be run for the workspace root (e.g. mesop git repo dir)

# Notes

- Does not generate very visually appealing outputs, they all look pretty similar. Need to have more examples with a wider range that are visually appealing.
- It likes to generate these card-like UIs, but some of the padding looks a bit off.
- Tell it to not use such a big headline (headline-3) for the top text.
- It sometimes still outputs non-code despite the instruction, make the text cleaning more robust.
