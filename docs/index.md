# Overview

Mesop is a Python-based UI framework that allows you to rapidly build web demos. Engineers without frontend experience can build web UIs by writing idiomatic Python code.

> Disclaimer: _This is not an officially supported Google product._

## Why Mesop?

- Mesop allows engineers without FE experience to build internal applications in their native language (e.g. Python).
- Mesop is built on battle-tested [Angular](https://angular.dev/) web framework and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) components.
- Mesop provides a flexible and composable component system and allows you to build custom UIs _without_ writing Javascript/CSS/HTML.
